    abstract = "{Survey participants are increasingly responding to Web surveys on their smartphones as opposed to their personal computers (PCs), and this change brings with it some potential data-quality issues. This study reports on a randomized crossover experiment to compare the effect of two different devices, smartphones and PCs, on response quality in a Web survey conducted in a probability-based panel. Participants (n = 1,390) were invited to complete an online questionnaire on both a smartphone (mobile Web) and PC (PC Web) in sequence. We hypothesized that smartphone use would result in lower-quality responses because people are more likely to use smartphones while multitasking or while around other people and because they could have difficulty recording their answers using a small touchscreen. While we found that respondents who participated in this study were more likely to multitask and more likely to be around other people when using smartphones, these factors had little impact on data quality. Respondents were at least as likely to provide conscientious and thoughtful answers and to disclose sensitive information on smartphones as on PCs. When using smartphones, however, respondents seemed to have trouble accurately moving a small-sized slider handle and a date-picker wheel to the intended values. Overall, we find that people using smartphones can provide high-quality responses, even when their context is more distracting, as long as they are presented with question formats that are easy to use on small touchscreens.}",

    abstract = "{More and more respondents use mobile devices to complete web
        surveys. These devices have different characteristics, if compared to
        PCs (e.g. smaller screen sizes and higher portability). These
        characteristics can affect the survey responses, mostly when a
        questionnaire includes sensitive questions. This topic was already
        studied by Mavletova and Couper (2013), through a two-wave experiment
        comparing PCs and mobile devices results for the same respondents in a
        Russian opt-in panel. We replicated this cross-over design, focusing on
        an opt-in panel for Spain, involving 1,800 panellists and comparing PCs
        and smartphones. Our results support most of Mavletova and Couper’s
        (2013) findings (e.g. generally the used device does not significantly
        affect the reporting of sensitive information), confirming their
        robustness over the two studied countries. For other results (e.g. trust
        in data confidentiality), we found differences that can be justified by
        the diverse context/culture or by the quick changes that are still
        characterizing the mobile web survey participation.}",

    abstract = {This study compares estimates of self-reported substance use
        and psychological well-being obtained in computer-assisted and
            paper-and-pencil self-administered surveys. We examine the extent
            to which mode effects on surveys responses are moderated by
            respondent characteristics and respondent attitudes, including
            attitudes toward computers, attitudes about confidentiality and
            privacy, and their general mistrust of others. Respondents age
            12-34 were selected through a multistage area probability sample
            of urban and suburban areas nationally and were randomly assigned
            to interview mode. There were few main effects of mode on
            self-reported substance use and well-being. Significant
            mode-by-age interaction terms revealed that adolescents were more
            sensitive to mode of administration than older respondents.
            Adolescents reported significantly higher levels of alcohol use,
        illicit drug use, and psychological distress in the computer mode
            than on paper self-administered questionnaires. Significant
            mode-by-mistrust interactions were also found. Respondents with
            higher levels of mistrust in other were less likely to report
            substance use in the computer mode than in the paper-and-pencil
            format.},
