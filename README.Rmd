## What does this package do for me?

`mapscanner` is an **R** package that enables maps to be printed out, drawn on,
scanned back in, and have the drawn components converted to spatial objects. It
is intended for use in social surveys and similar endeavours in which printed
paper maps are preferred over digital screens, and enables marks drawn by hand
on paper maps to be converted to spatial objects. The use of paper maps is
often advantageous because (i) they cost much less than computer devices
otherwise needed for digital equivalents; and (ii) they may in many situations
be deemed to yield more reliable or accurate results through removing the
psychological barriers often associated with screen-based surveys.
Currently [under
review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/330#event-2513283441)
at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org).

## installation

`mapscanner` is not (yet) on CRAN. The development version can be installed with
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
remote::install_github("mpadge/mapscanner")
```
The package can then be loaded for usage in a R session with
```{r library}
library (mapscanner)
```

## usage

The package is designed to enable the following workflow:

1. Generate a map with the
   [`ms_generate_map()`](https://mpadge.github.io/mapscanner/reference/ms_generate_map.html)
   function, which automatically produces both `.pdf` and `.png` versions;

2. Print the `.pdf` version to use as desired in any kind of survey environment;

3. Draw on the map;

4. Digitise the drawn-on (from here on, "modified") map, converting it to
   either `.pdf` or `.png` format; and

5. Rectify the modified version against the original via the
   [`ms_rectify_maps()`](https://mpadge.github.io/mapscanner/reference/ms_rectify_maps.html)
   function, which distinguishes individual annotations,
   and converts each one to a spatial object able to be analysed in any desired
   manner.

### Practical tips

Unlike most software packages, `mapscanner` is intended to aid a *practical*
workflow, and so a few practical tips may be recommended here to ensure best
results:

1. The original digital files generated with
   [`ms_generate_map()`](https://mpadge.github.io/mapscanner/reference/ms_generate_map.html)
   are necessary to rectify subsequently drawn-on and scanned maps, and so must
   be retained at all times.
2. Marks drawn on maps should be *coloured* -- any black or grey markings will
   be ignored. This has the advantage that individual annotations *not*
   intended to be converted to spatial objects (such as unique identification
   or participant codes) may be made on maps in black or grey.
3. For drawings of areas, care should be taken to ensure all lines form closed
   polygons; only in cases where this is not possible or practicable, the `type
   = "hulls"` argument should be used in map rectification, as described
   further below.
4. Digitised versions should contain *white* borders, so do not, for example,
   photograph modified maps lying on dark surfaces. If maps are to be
   photographed, then best results can be achieved by simply placing them on
   a larger, enclosing sheet of white paper.

The following two sections describe the two primary functions of the
`mapscanner` package, corresponding to the two primary steps of producing maps
to be used in surveys, and rectifying modified maps against these originals in
order to extract spatial objects. The second of these sections also describes
the kinds of markings able to be recognised, and the kinds of spatial objects
to which these may be converted.


### Mapbox API tokens

Map generation with `mapscanner` requires a personal token or key from
[`mapbox`](https://mapbox.com), which can be obtained by following the links
from
[https://docs.mapbox.com/api](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/#access-tokens-and-token-scopes).
If you already have a token, the easiest way to use it with `mapscanner` is to
create (or edit) a file `~/.Renviron`, and insert a line,

``` bash
MAPBOX_TOKEN=<my_mapbox_token>
```
This will then be available every time you start R, without any need to
explicitly set the token each time you want to use the package. The token may
be given any unique name that includes "mapbox" (case insensitive).
Alternatively, if you wish to keep your token truly private, and only use it
for your current R session, you may load `mapscanner`, and then run
`set_mapbox_token(<my_mapbox_token>)`.

### Map generation

Having obtained and set a [`mapbox`](https://mapbox.com) token as described
above, `mapscanner` may then be used to generate maps. The package comes with
a sample map of Omaha, Nebraska, USA, and one with some red lines drawn on it:
![](./man/figures/omaha-polygons.png)

That's just a standard `png` image with no notion of geographical coordinates.
The original map was generated with

```{r omaha-fakey, eval = FALSE}
bbox <- rbind (c (-96.12923, -96.01011),
               c (41.26145, 41.32220)) # portion of omaha
ms_generate_map (bbox, max_tiles = 16L, mapname = "omaha")
```
```{r omaha, echo = FALSE}
bbox <- rbind (c (-96.12923, -96.01011),
               c (41.26145, 41.32220))
message ("Successfully generated 'omaha.pdf' and 'omaha.png'")
```
As indicated, the function generates a map in both `.pdf` and `.png` formats.
These files must be retained as the "master" maps against which subsequently
modified -- drawn-over and scanned-in -- versions will be rectified. 


### Map rectification

The magic within the `mapscanner` package happens via the [`RNiftyReg`
package](https://github.com/jonclayden/RNiftyReg), itself primarily intended to
align brain scans and other medical images, but which is precisely the tool
needed here. The package comes with two sample `.png` images which can be used
to demonstrate map rectification. In the following code, `f_modified` is the
image shown above, modified from the original by drawing a red line around
a particular region of Omaha.
```{r scan_maps}
f_orig <- system.file ("extdata", "omaha.png", package = "mapscanner")
f_mod <- system.file ("extdata", "omaha-polygons.png", package = "mapscanner")
res <- ms_rectify_maps (f_orig, f_mod, type = "polygons")
res
```
The rectification can take quite some time, during which [`RNiftyReg`
package](https://github.com/jonclayden/RNiftyReg) is constructing the best
transformation of the modified image back on to the original. The result of
`ms_rectify_maps()` is a spatial object in
[`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf)-format in which each drawn
component is represented as a separate polygon. Finally, we can plot the result
as an interactive map using packages like
[`mapview`](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview) with the following commands:
```{r mapview, eval = FALSE}
library (mapview)
mapview (res)
```
or [`mapdeck`](https://github.com/symbolixAU/mapdeck), which similarly requires
a mapbox token:
```{r mapdeck, eval = FALSE}
library (mapdeck)
set_token (Sys.getenv ("<my_mapbox_token>"))
mapdeck () %>%
    add_polygon (res, fill_colour = "#ffff00cc",
                 stroke_colour = "#ff0000", stroke_width = 20)
```


```{r leaflet, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

leaflet (res) %>%
    addPolygons (color = "#FF1111", weight = 1, opacity = 1.0,
                 fillOpacity = 0.5) %>%
    addProviderTiles ("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
    setView (lng = mean (bbox [1, ]),
             lat = mean (bbox [2, ]),
             zoom = 12)
```

![](./man/figures/leaflet-1.png)

And our hand-drawn lines shown above have been converted to standard spatial
objects able to be analysed in any desired way. See the [package
vignette](https://mpadge.github.io/mapscanner/articles/mapscanner.html) for
more detail of what the `mapscanner` package can do.
