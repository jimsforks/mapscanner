Print maps, draw on them, scan them back in, and convert to spatial objects.
Package comes with a sample map of Omaha, Nebraska, USA, and one with some red
lines drawn on it:
![](./inst/extdata/omaha_drawn.jpg)

That's just a standard `jpeg` image with no notion of geographical coordinates.
The original map was generated with

```{r load}
devtools::load_all (".", export_all = FALSE)
```
```{r omaha-fakey, eval = FALSE}
bbox <- osmdata:getbb ("omaha nebraska")
ms_generate_map (bbox, max_tiles = 16L, mapname = "omaha")
```
```{r omaha, echo = FALSE}
bbox <- rbind (c (-96.12923, -96.01011),
               c (41.26145, 41.32220))
message ("Successfully generated 'omaha.pdf' and 'omaha.jpg'")
readRDS ("my_map.Rds")
```
As indicated, the function generates a map in both `.pdf` and `.jpg` formats.
These files must be retained as the "master" maps against which subsequently
modified -- draw-over and scanned-in -- versions will be rectified. The `.pdf`
format is generated because it will generally be the most convenient for
printing, while the rectification itself requires `.jpg`-format images. The
magic happens via the [`RNiftyReg`
package](https://github.com/jonclayden/RNiftyReg), itself primarily intended to
align brain scans and other medical images, but which is precisely the tool
needed here.

The `mapscanner` package comes with two `.jpg` images which can be used to
demonstrate, where `f_modified` is the image shown above, modified from the
original by drawing a red line around a particular region of Omaha.
```{r scan_maps}
f_original <- file.path ("inst", "extdata", "omaha.jpg")
f_modified <- file.path ("inst", "extdata", "omaha_drawn.jpg")
system.time (res <- ms_rectify_maps (f_original, f_modified))
res
```
The rectification can take quite some time, during which [`RNiftyReg`
package](https://github.com/jonclayden/RNiftyReg) is constructing the best
transformation of the modified image back on to the original.

Finally, we can plot the result as an interactive map using packages like
[`mapdeck`](https://github.com/symbolixAU/mapdeck), or
[`mapview`](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview):

```{r leaflet, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

leaflet (res) %>%
    addPolygons (color = "#FF1111", weight = 1, opacity = 1.0,
                 fillOpacity = 0.5) %>%
    addProviderTiles ("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
    setView (lng = mean (bbox [1, ]),
             lat = mean (bbox [2, ]),
             zoom = 12)
```
