Print maps, draw on them, scan them back in, and convert to spatial objects.
Package comes with a sample map of Omaha, Nebraska, USA, and one with some red
lines drawn on it:
![](./inst/extdata/omaha_drawn.jpg)

That's just a standard `jpeg` image with no notion of geographical coordinates.
The original map was generated with

```{r load}
devtools::load_all (".", export_all = FALSE)
```
```{r omaha-fakey, eval = FALSE}
bbox <- rbind (c (-96.12923, -96.01011),
               c (41.26145, 41.32220))
omaha <- ms_get_map (loc, max_tiles = 16L)
```
```{r omaha, echo = FALSE}
omaha <- readRDS ("my_map.Rds")
```

That map it itself a `RasterBrick` object from the [`raster`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=raster), which can be converted to
`pdf` format for printing with 
```{r map2pdf, eval = FALSE}
ms_map_to_pdf (omaha, file = "omaha")
```

That version can then be printed out and either scanned back in, or simply
photographed with a mobile device. The original `raster` object is all 
that's need to rectify the scanned image with the original map. The magic is
performed via the [`RNiftyReg`
package](https://github.com/jonclayden/RNiftyReg), itself primarily intended to
align brain scans and other medical images, but which is precisely the tool
needed here.

To try it out here, we can use the [`magick`
package](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) to convert the internally bundled
image files to `pdf` versions:

```{r jpg2pdf-fakey, eval = FALSE}
system.file ("extdata", "omaha.jpg", package = "mapscanner") %>%
    magick::image_read () %>%
    magick::image_write (path = "omaha.pdf", format = "pdf")
system.file ("extdata", "omaha_drawn.jpg", package = "mapscanner") %>%
    magick::image_read () %>%
    magick::image_write (path = "omaha.pdf", format = "pdf")
```
```{r jpg2pdf, echo = FALSE}
file.path ("inst", "extdata", "omaha.jpg") %>%
    magick::image_read () %>%
    magick::image_write (path = "omaha.pdf", format = "pdf")
file.path ("inst", "extdata", "omaha_drawn.jpg") %>%
    magick::image_read () %>%
    magick::image_write (path = "omaha_drawn.pdf", format = "pdf")
```

That gives us `pdf` versions of the above image file, and the original before
it was drawn on. The two can be rectified with the single command:
```{r scan-maps, eval = FALSE}
result <- scan_maps ("omaha.pdf", "omaha_drawn.pdf")
```
