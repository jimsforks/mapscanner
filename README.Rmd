R package to print maps, draw on them, scan them back in, and convert to
spatial objects. Currently [under
review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/330#event-2513283441)
at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org).

## installation

`mapscanner` is not (yet) on CRAN. The development version can be installed with
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
remote::install_github("mpadge/mapscanner")
```
The package can then be loaded for usage in a R session with
```{r library}
library (mapscanner)
```

## usage

### Mapbox API tokens

Map generation with `mapscanner` requires a personal token or key from
[`mapbox`](https://mapbox.com), which can be obtained by following the links
from
[https://docs.mapbox.com/api](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/#access-tokens-and-token-scopes). If you already have a token, the easier way to use it with `mapscanner` is to create (or edit) a file `~/.Renviron`, and insert a line,
``` bash
MAPBOX_TOKEN=<my_mapbox_token>
```
This will then be available every time you start R. The token may be given any
unique name that includes "mapbox" (case insensitive). Alternatively, if you wish to keep your token truly private, and only use it for your current R session, you may load `mapscanner`, and then type `set_mapbox_token(<my_mapbox_token>)`.

### Map generation

Having obtained and set a [`mapbox`](https://mapbox.com) token as described
above, `mapscanner` may then be used to generate maps. The package comes with
a sample map of Omaha, Nebraska, USA, and one with some red lines drawn on it:
![](./man/figures/omaha-polygons.png)

That's just a standard `png` image with no notion of geographical coordinates.
The original map was generated with

```{r omaha-fakey, eval = FALSE}
bbox <- rbind (c (-96.12923, -96.01011),
               c (41.26145, 41.32220)) # portion of omaha
ms_generate_map (bbox, max_tiles = 16L, mapname = "omaha")
```
```{r omaha, echo = FALSE}
bbox <- rbind (c (-96.12923, -96.01011),
               c (41.26145, 41.32220))
message ("Successfully generated 'omaha.pdf' and 'omaha.png'")
```
As indicated, the function generates a map in both `.pdf` and `.png` formats.
These files must be retained as the "master" maps against which subsequently
modified -- drawn-over and scanned-in -- versions will be rectified. The `.pdf`
format is generated because it will generally be the most convenient for
printing, while the rectification itself requires `.png`-format images. 


### Map rectification

The magic within the `mapscanner` package happens via the [`RNiftyReg`
package](https://github.com/jonclayden/RNiftyReg), itself primarily intended to
align brain scans and other medical images, but which is precisely the tool
needed here. The package comes with two sample `.png` images which can be used
to demonstrate map rectification. In the following code, `f_modified` is the
image shown above, modified from the original by drawing a red line around
a particular region of Omaha.
```{r scan_maps}
f_orig <- system.file ("extdata", "omaha.png", package = "mapscanner")
f_mod <- system.file ("extdata", "omaha-polygons.png", package = "mapscanner")
system.time (res <- ms_rectify_maps (f_orig, f_mod, type = "polygons"))
res
```
The rectification can take quite some time, during which [`RNiftyReg`
package](https://github.com/jonclayden/RNiftyReg) is constructing the best
transformation of the modified image back on to the original. The result of
`ms_rectify_maps()` is a spatial object in
[`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf)-format in which each drawn
component is represented as a separate polygon. Finally, we can plot the result
as an interactive map using packages like
[`mapdeck`](https://github.com/symbolixAU/mapdeck), or
[`mapview`](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview):

```{r leaflet, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

leaflet (res) %>%
    addPolygons (color = "#FF1111", weight = 1, opacity = 1.0,
                 fillOpacity = 0.5) %>%
    addProviderTiles ("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
    setView (lng = mean (bbox [1, ]),
             lat = mean (bbox [2, ]),
             zoom = 12)
```

![](./man/figures/leaflet-1.png)

And our hand-drawn lines shown above have been converted to standard spatial
objects able to be analysed in any desired way. See the [package
vignette](https://mpadge.github.io/mapscanner/articles/mapscanner.html) for
more detail of what the `mapscanner` package can do.
