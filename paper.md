# Summary

`mapscanner` is an **R** package that enables lines drawn by hand on maps to be
converted to spatial objects. The package has two primary functions: one for
producing maps, and one for rectifying hand-drawn lines to the coordinate
system of the original map. The package is intended for use in social surveys
and similar endeavours in which hand-drawn markings on maps need to be
converted to spatial objects. Maps can be either paper- or screen-based.
Markings on paper maps need to be scanned, photographed, or otherwise
digitised, while maps with screen-based markings need to be saved as
`.png`-format images.
