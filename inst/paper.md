# Summary

`mapscanner` is an **R** package that enables maps to be printed out, drawn on,
scanned back in, and have the drawn components converted to spatial objects. It
is intended for use in social surveys and similar endeavours in which printed
paper maps are preferred over digital screens, and enables marks drawn by hand
on paper maps to be converted to spatial objects. The use of paper maps is
often advantageous because (i) they cost much less than computer devices
otherwise needed for digital equivalents; and (ii) they may in many situations
be deemed to yield more reliable or accurate results through removing the
psychological barriers often associated with screen-based surveys [@Toninelli2016].
